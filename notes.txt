anomalies observed:

- one or more spaces before and/or after values in all columns except the id

- one or more carriage returns/line feeds in the middle of a row

- one or more extra tabs in the middle of a row

- three consecutive name fields; when this occurs, assume 2nd and 3rd are the
  last name and join with a space or remove one if identical

observations/judgements:

- all of the first column values (id) for the good rows can be cast to int
  without a problem, so no need to trim spaces on those

- an email address has to contain a “@“ character, so can validate the 5th
  column contains one; not worth the complexity or performance to do a full
  email regex

- account numbers all start with [1-9], so can validate account number vs name
  field by looking at that digit; optionally could have cleansed ‘-‘ and ‘/‘
  from account numbers and tried converting to an int

- further normalization of names could be attempted by changing case, however,
  names such as “McGrath” would be hard to deal with elegantly, and all upper
  case or all lower case aren’t particularly appealing

- some otherwise valid rows have missing first name, last name, or both;
  they are assumed to be allowed as the output is still a valid TSV and
  sometimes that information might be missing for a user

- email addresses could easily be normalized by changing to all lower case if
  needed or desired
